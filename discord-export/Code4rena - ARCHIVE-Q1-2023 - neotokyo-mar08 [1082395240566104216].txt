The Neo Tokyo ecosystem can be a bit complicated to understand. The staker logic is fairly straightforward but has a few nuances in how it interacts with different parts of Neo Tokyo items. Please do not hesitate to ask me any questions you may have.

> Neo Tokyo S1 Citizens are currently created by burning BYTES 1.0 tokens and combining an S1 Identity, S1 Item, S1 Land, and optionally an S1 Vault. 

does this mean that you can use `beckLoot.claim()` in the test setup but in the live version you use `NTCitizenDeploy.mintIdentity()` which burns the BYTES? `createCitizen()` which is used in the testsuite doesnt seem to burn BYTES, right?


[03/09/2023 14:37] y1cunhui
After reading through the only material: README, I still have no idea of what the whole Neo Tokyo Ecosystem is, and waht's the relationship between the so many out-of-scope contracts(s1,  s2...) and the in-scope 2 contracts. I thought there would be some systematic introduction of the whole system....Or does understanding the entire ecosystem have no bearing on the two contracts we need to audit?

Thank you for catching this, I'll update the `package.json` accordingly. We did test a clean install but may have missed this due to either global dependencies or due to not using yarn.


[03/09/2023 17:48] tim_clancy.eth
I use the word `window` in this contract to refer to a fixed period of time between two timestamps. For example, this concept is used in `NeoTokyoStaker.getPoolReward`:
```js
/*
    Determine the reward for the `_recipient` based on their points total. 
    Iterate through the entire array of pool reward windows to find the 
    applicable time period.
*/
uint256 totalReward;
uint256 lastPoolRewardTime = lastRewardTime[_recipient][_assetType];
uint256 windowCount = pool.rewardCount;
for (uint256 i; i < windowCount; ) {
  ...
}
```
to iterate through each asset pool's mapping of `RewardWindow` structs:
```js
/**
    This struct defines a specific time window in reward emission history. For 
    a particular asset staking pool, it represents that beginning from 
    `startTime`, the pool had a per-second reward emission rate of `reward`.

    @param startTime The time at which the daily reward activated.
    @param reward The reward emission rate beginning at `startTime`.
*/
struct RewardWindow {
    uint128 startTime;
    uint128 reward;
}

/**
    This struct is used to define both the configuration details for a 
    particular asset staking pool and the state of that pool as callers begin 
    interacting with it.

    @param totalPoints The total number of points in the pool.
    @param daoTax The percent, in basis points, of the reward emissions sent to 
        the DAO.
    @param rewardCount A count of the number of reward windows in the 
        `rewardWindows` mapping, used for iterating.
    @param rewardWindows A mapping of the historic amount of BYTES token     
        rewarded per-second across all stakers in this particular pool.
*/
struct PoolData {
    uint256 totalPoints;
    uint256 daoTax;
    uint256 rewardCount;
    mapping ( uint256 => RewardWindow ) rewardWindows;
}
```
and perhaps the above documentation explains it best: rewards are accumulated at different rates between different logical timestamps that an administrator can set to change the rate of rewards over time.


[03/09/2023 17:49] tim_clancy.eth
You can find an example of the rewards being dynamically adjusted like this in several of the test cases, like this:
```js
// Simulate a change in reward rates 16-hours into Alice's stake.
await ethers.provider.send('evm_setNextBlockTimestamp', [
    aliceStakeTime + (60 * 60 * 16)
]);
await NTStaking.connect(owner.signer).configurePools(
    [
        {
            assetType: ASSETS.S1_CITIZEN.id,
            daoTax: S1_DAO_SHARE,
            rewardWindows: [
                {
                    startTime: 0,
                    reward: ethers.utils.parseEther('200').div(60 * 60 * 24)
                },
                {
                    startTime: aliceStakeTime + (60 * 60 * 16),
                    reward: ethers.utils.parseEther('150').div(60 * 60 * 24)
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
);
```

^ in this example, the S1 Citizen rewards are being configured such that they are "200 per day" reduced to "150 per day" beginning at the `aliceStakeTime + (60 * 60 * 16)` timestamp.

[03/09/2023 18:26] tim_clancy.eth
Correct. That behavior of the Neo Tokyo ecosystem is out of scope for this audit but I should have explained it anyways. Here's what happens on mainnet:
- `beckLoot.claim()` can claim some Neo Tokyo Identity items.
- Neo Tokyo also has the concept of Bought Identities which behave insofar as `NeoTokyoStaker` is concerned the same way that the `beckLoot.claim()` Identity items do.
- It appears you are correct, the testing setup of `createCitizen()` does not do that. Insofar as the `NeoTokyoStaker` is concerned that also doesn't matter: every asset that is not `BYTES2` already exists in the Neo Tokyo ecosystem and will exist before a caller stakes them.

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/09/2023 18:37] tim_clancy.eth
Certainly. When staking any asset in the `NeoTokyoStaker`, we must assign the staker a score in points to determine what share of the emission rewards they earn. See https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1083447614508384377/1083453445660487830.

Ccompared to S2 Citizens and LP tokens, S1 Citizens support a more detailed method of assigning a points score.
  0. At the time of their creation, S1 Citizens may be assembled with a Vault. We call this kind of Vault that is part of an S1 Citizen "a component Vault" to distinguish it from a non-component Vault which may also be staked alongside the S1 Citizen at the time of staking. An S1 Citizen also must be assembled with an Identity, "a component Identity".
  1. Each component Identity of a Neo Tokyo S1 Citizen has a "Credit Yield" metadata trait, like this https://gigamart.com/collections/neo-tokyo-identities/1023 item which has a "Credit Yield" of "Low".
  2. Administrative functions of the `NeoTokyoStaker` contract allow Neo Tokyo administrators to assign points to the S1 Citizen based on the value of its component Identity, these are the "Identity Points".
  3. Therefore, when you stake an S1 Citizen, its weight in points is a function of these Identity Points, a multiplier based on an admin-configured timelock, a multiplier based on an admin-configured bonus of any associated Vault's "Credit Multiplier", and a bonus based on any `BYTES2` optionally staked into the S1 Citizen.

[03/09/2023 18:56] dec3ntraliz3d
Thanks Tim! So, an S1 citizen without a companion vault can choose to stake or not stake their vault. However, an S1 citizen with a companion vault will be automatically staked when the citizen is staked, as the companion vault is tied to the citizen's staking status.

Heya frens! Quick question: what does `Any changes to the smart contracts which are stylistic in nature are also out of scope` exactly mean?


[03/09/2023 19:08] tim_clancy.eth
Exactly! The non-component Vault staking is just there so a staker can get the benefit of using a Vault as if they had put a Vault into their S1 Citizen without having to first disassemble their S1 Citizen and reassemble it with the Vault.

It means I don't really want to argue with wardens about my naming conventions, whether every line of my block comments should start with `*`, whether an 80 character limit is actually a good idea, whether I should actually invoke divine protection via `@custom:benediction` tags, etc. I've been doing contracts for a while and this is the general style I've generally grown to be comfortable in, any popular linters be damned.
```
license
pragma
external imports
my imports
errors
contract
constants
structs/state variables in order of appearance
events
constructors
view functions
user-functions in order of appearance
admin-functions

but there are no rewards for matching that ordering perfectly.

Good question, it's one final factor that changes S1 Citizen scoring that I'd missed. S1 Citizens have classes, one of those classes is "Hand of the Citadel", and an S1 of that class should receive the multiplier as if it has a `?` reward rate Vault whether or not it actually does.

Hello ser, what is the *difference* between a component vault & a non-component vault?


[03/10/2023 23:10] tim_clancy.eth
Neo Tokyo S1 Citizens can be assembled from their component NFTs (Identity, Item, Land, and _optionally_ a Vault). They need not necessarily contain a Vault. I call such a Vault logically assembled into an S1 Citizen "a component Vault" to distinguish it from a "non-component Vault" which was not assembled into an S1 Citizen.


[03/10/2023 23:10] tim_clancy.eth
S1 Citizens without component Vaults may have a non-component Vault supplied at the time of staking which they can earn benefits from.


[03/11/2023 08:45] parsely.
Please may I check for my own understanding , when staking ```if (_pools[_assetType].rewardWindows[0].startTime >= block.timestamp) {``` would there ever possibly be a scenario where the rewardWindow starts and someone stakes in the same block.timestamp?


[03/11/2023 08:56] descharre
Staking participants may also stake BYTES 2.0 tokens into their S1 or S2 Citizens in order to boost the points weight of those Citizens at a rate of 200 BYTES per point.

Does this mean you need 200 bytes for 1 extra base point?


[03/11/2023 12:49] santipu_
But `_pools[_assetType].rewardWindows[0].startTime` shouldn't always be zero?

[03/12/2023 02:45] tim_clancy.eth
Correct; our intent is to deploy with similar settings to the test cases: the first reward window for each asset pool will have a start time of 0. Any other situation is administrator misconfiguration. I will add this to the FAQ.

{Reactions}
💯 

[03/12/2023 02:50] tim_clancy.eth
>  would there ever possibly be a scenario where the rewardWindow starts and someone stakes in the same block.timestamp

In principle it is possible though unlikely that an admin configures a reward window (i.e. schedules some future change in the emission rate for a particular asset pool) to occur at some specific timestamp and a staker just so happens to enter the pool at that exact timestamp.

In practice, now that we live in a post-Merge world with exactly 12 second block times, we can make sure that whatever time the admin configures could not possibly be a valid Ethereum mainnet `block.timestamp`.


[03/12/2023 02:51] tim_clancy.eth
Correct, that is the intent. 200 BYTES = 1 base point = 100 basis point points.

{Reactions}
✅ 

[03/12/2023 02:54] tim_clancy.eth
When we bring this staking system live we will update the mainnet Neo Tokyo S1 Citizens (`NTCitizenDeploy`) to begin referring to `BYTES2` instead of the current BYTES1. In the S1 Citizen smart contract, certain operations which we must maintain the functionality of (such as the ERC-721 `transferFrom` function) require calling `.updateReward` and `.updateRewardOnMint` on the BYTES contract. The original logic for what these functions used to do is no longer applicable because we're moving to the `NeoTokyoStaker` for all logic related to earning `BYTES2` tokens, but we need the no-op to not break things in the S1 Citizen contract.

Even when I wrote a new test on foundry, the contract wouldn't run due to `Identifier already declared`

It's the node version. When I switched from 14 to 16, everything worked.

Hi Tim, how many bytes tokens will be allowed to enter circulation?

@tim-clancy.eth can you explain the reward window in a more clear way ?


[03/13/2023 18:46] tim_clancy.eth
A test case demonstrating the attack would be greatly preferable, but a reasonably-detailed description of how the attack might work such that I can at least go and implement that test case myself later is acceptable.

This is intended to be called by a user only when they decide to claim (or someone else pays gas to claim on their behalf).

[03/13/2023 18:49] tim_clancy.eth
Supply is intended to asymptotically approach 5M total BYTES tokens, i.e. with 18 decimal places `5_000_000_000000000000000000`.

👍 

[03/13/2023 19:02] golanger
Ok thanks and is this a combination of bytes 1 and 2 tokens? Or just the latter?


[03/13/2023 19:04] tim_clancy.eth
The combination of the two. Assuming that the current ~2.17M BYTES1 eventually get migrated into BYTES2.

https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1082395240566104216/1083446168295575582 does this help? If you need some additional clarification I'm happy to provide it.


[03/13/2023 19:20] golanger
And once it approaches the maximum amount in circulation, is a mechanism triggered to reduce the supply? Or is there a manual trigger for this?


[03/13/2023 19:24] tim_clancy.eth
This is manually admin-adjusted using `configurePools` to schedule diminishing returns over time.


[03/13/2023 20:05] golanger
Ok great, and is that designed to reduce the “rewards window” over time to prevent rewards being claimed? Is there a specific timeframe for this?


[03/13/2023 20:06] tim_clancy.eth
The idea is to reduce the emissions rate over time; rewards that you earned in a prior window are not intended to be reduced (it is possible to rugpull a user on prior earnings but that would fall under the matter of administrative misconfiguration).

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/13/2023 20:07] tim_clancy.eth
There is no specific timeframe at this time for administrator-triggered reward adjustment, no.

"npm install" seems not to work on your project. When I do "npm ls", I get a lot of errors, for example:

├── hardhat-contract-sizer@ invalid: "^2.1.1" from the root project
├── hardhat-gas-reporter@ invalid: "^1.0.4" from the root project
├── hardhat@ invalid: "^2.12.2" from the root project

"npx hardhat test" also not possible then. Have asked Google, it suggested some "npm update", but that didn't help either. I'm acutally a Python coder, my nodejs knowledge is thus pretty flat, but since everyone in web3 seems to prefer Javascript, I unfortunately must adapt sometimes 😌 Am a bit puzzled now. I'm running Debian 11, everything up-to-date, using the latest npm stable version.


[03/14/2023 06:32] drdounge
... tried now on Ubuntu 22.04, pretty much same problem:

├── UNMET DEPENDENCY hardhat-contract-sizer@^2.1.1
├── UNMET DEPENDENCY hardhat-gas-reporter@^1.0.4
├── UNMET DEPENDENCY hardhat@^2.12.2

Everything up-to-date. Tried with node 18, 16 and 14 (just to be sure). Not sure what else to try now. I mean I could try to update all modules AND the version declarations in the package.json . But I doubt that this makes sense, cause it changes the whole project.


[03/14/2023 08:05] dravee
Odd, but ok. Changing the version of hardhat shouldn't change the project too much as these are dev dependencies (tooling). You're not touching OZ's libs, as an example. Try to change the versions. Try to use yarn instead of npm. Try deleting the package-lock.json file. Try cleaning the cache with npm. 
I have no issue with the project, but I'm on MacOS

Edit: try installing those independently, like `npm install hardhat-gas-reporter`, you can add `--save-dev` to overwrite the version in package.json


[03/14/2023 08:09] parsely.
Just to share I ran npm install, and did not run into any issues, the tests run without an error.


[03/14/2023 08:10] dravee
Thanks! Which OS are you using?


[03/14/2023 08:12] parsely.
Ubuntu 22.10 on a Qemu virt machine.


[03/14/2023 08:18] aba1842
if all else fails, try `yarn` instead of `npm`. It worked effortlessly for me


[03/14/2023 08:22] parsely.
npm -v gives me 9.4.0


[03/14/2023 11:51] ubl4nk#1934
Hello guys, can someone give me some details about the point and multiplier in NeoTokyoStaking ?

@tim-clancy.eth May I DM you? Have a question


[03/14/2023 18:31] drdounge
@parsely @ABA 

yarn got it solved for me. Haven't tried anything else of your suggested solutions.

But it's still pretty strange. Especially my attempts on Ubuntu 22.04 should have worked, because it is a totally fresh setup VPS on Oracle Cloud. Also my Debian 11 attempts have been a totally fresh setup via vagrant and Virtual Box (though my Virtual Box is a bit outdated, but I don't think that this is a problem here).

But well, maybe it only works on Ubuntu 22.10 ??? Strange also that noone else reported about this issue. Maybe there are 90% macOS and Windows users here, and the 10% Linux guys use yarn lol.

I have used nvm. But I believe this is still the standard, right?

But now back to looking for web3 instead of node bugs. Thanks everyone for your help!


[03/14/2023 18:34] parsely.
Glad it's resolved.

We intend to always enforce a minimum timelock duration which will just give a 1x multiplier. Staking BYTES into Citizens inherently comes with a timelock given that the Citizens themselves have a timelock component.

{Reactions}
✅ 

[03/15/2023 17:07] tim_clancy.eth
Conventional wisdom is that it is more gas-efficient to use a mapping instead of an array with what I'm using them for here. Other than that no real reason. Personal ergonomics, I suppose.

[04/12/2023 08:42] hansfriese
@ABA 
Your submission was downgraded to QA as it's about the normal rounding issue.
And each QA should be marked as grade-a/b/c. So `grade-b` is not the score of that issue only, it's for your QA report.

hi @hansfriese, I also wanted to ask you a question if possible 🙏🏼 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-neotokyo-findings/issues/227

My issue was satisfactory and then considered out of scope. I checked the contest rules again, and it says:

> The only contracts that are in scope for this contest are the two listed below, excluding any concerns regarding centralization or malicious administrator risk.

As it wasn't considered a malicious act, but it's the intended usage, I don't get why it should be considered out of scope.

Sponsor replied:

> Out of scope because we assume that the admin is competent and non-malicious; there is no operational intent to ever change timelock values in this fashion.

But it's for neither of these reasons, as this function is meant to be reusable. You can only append new timelocks safely, but if you override the existing ones it causes issues, and this isn't documented anywhere.

It would be great if you could explain the reasoning behind this 🙏🏼

Let me explain
1. `configureTimelockOptions()` is out of scope.
2. This becomes problematic after the admin changed the multiplier settings. But from the sponsor's comment at #324, `there is no operational intent to ever change timelock values in this fashion`
There were some other submissions about the admin misconfiguration and they were all marked as out of scope according to the contest's disclaimer. The ReadMe says all submissions about the admin misconfiguration are out of scope.

my bad, it was in the list of out of scope functions, I didn't notice. Thanks for the explanation! :hi5:

Hi, I was reading the report and if the Hs are clear, I don't understand L-08 
`[L-08] Keccak Constant values should used to immutable rather than constant`
https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-03-neotokyo/#l-08-keccak-constant-values-should-used-to-immutable-rather-than-constant
Why `immutable` is recommended instead of `constant`  in this case?

In Quality Assurance Engineering, the perspectives may not be the same as in M and H, we see that here too.


The issue is related to the use of constant and immutable variables in the Keccak algorithm. Specifically, the Keccak Constant values should be used as immutable rather than constant variables. 

Constant context is ; It should not calculate, it was not written directly, for example; uint256 constant = 5;


This is a context, blockchain and EVM are very new concepts, they are constantly developing, but they are still in their infancy, so separating the concepts clearly shows a more correct development for the future, you can think of it as the philosophical side of software

Hey, so what I've got is even if there is no difference (in the sense of side effects) between using constant vs immutable in this case, we should respect a good practice list to make our life easier in future and avoid mixing the concepts. Thank you for answering my Q.
